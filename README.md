In this project, I built an MP3 Music Player App in Java!
## Technologies & Frameworks

- **JDK 18+** - Java Version
- **Mp3Magic** - A Java library for reading mp3 files and manipulating mp3 file ID3 tags
- **JLayer** - MP3 decoder/player/converter library for the Java™ platform.
- **JAudioTagger** - A Java library for editing tag information in audio files. Most existing solutions are not Java-based, inhibiting the use of Java applications with digital files.
